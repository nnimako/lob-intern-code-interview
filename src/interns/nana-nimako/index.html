        Hello, my name is Nana Nimako. I am a student studying Computer Science at the University of Vermont. I am an enthusiastic, problem-solving and goal-oriented programmer looking forward to join Lob as a Software Engineering intern. After reading the job desciption and cracking the code interview, I believe I have the neccessary skillset to succeed at this position. 
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, I am a zealous student and open to learn new things as the day passes by. I am looking forward to this internship and hope to learn a lot from this experience if granted the opportunity. Some of these including the ability to learn and gain some real world experience before graduating from school. Not only would I learn that but also better some of the skill already gained during my time here at UVM. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I have had the chance to work at the Office of Institutional Research as a Computer Programmer Intern at the University of Vermont to which can be found on my resume. A handful of projects have been completed as well. These have helped me grow both as a person and also as a programmer. I hope that I could be granted the opportunity to work along side Lob's Engineering Team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some main applications or software I would like to create involves those that have technologies to make the life of users simple. I hope my software can be easily integratable and also easitly automated leaving my end user to do less work yet produce more.
